Most likely, we are all familiar with the concept of UX or "User Experience," or at least have heard its name. However, the term DX may be less common and less discussed. **Developer Experience**, or "Development Experience," is used when our product is an API, and its audience is developers.

## What is DX?
DX is about the feelings of developers when interacting with an API. Since developers are generally considered intelligent individuals, this aspect may not receive much attention unless a company (with an API product) feels threatened by its competitors (with a similar product).

While the concept of Developer Experience can prevent wasted developer time interacting with various internal services (or APIs) even within a service-oriented architecture company.

## Why does Development Experience matter?
As mentioned earlier, a poor experience and complexity in using an API can discourage users and reduce the likelihood of continued use of your product. Worse, it may lead the developer towards your competitor. Developers' time is limited, and they shouldn't spend a significant portion of it understanding the API and its implementation.

A designer and developer familiar with an API's database structure, program logic, defaults, and code complexities, but a developer intending to use your product is not aware of these details. Therefore, conditions must be provided to instill confidence in the API's performance and ensure a correct understanding of its functionality and received results.

## To have a better DX, what actions should be taken?
Now that we understand the importance of this experience, we need to know what actions can raise this criterion and keep customers happier.

1. **Simplify the API understanding process:**
   Consider documentation as an essential part of your product. A developer spends a considerable amount of time reading product documentation to use your API. Creating and maintaining these documents, logical organization, step-by-step guidance, and providing good examples facilitate the API usage process, addressing user needs to a great extent. Additionally, creating an API Console can be interesting, allowing users to test API functionality in real-time and expedite the learning process.

2. **Ease API usage:**
   Minimize the "non-coding" steps involved in using your product. Complicating the registration process, contacting sales for services, or anything that makes the developer's workflow complicated and slow should be minimized. Provide SDKs for developers with different languages, motivating users to come to your product with more enthusiasm. If maintaining the SDKs you created for your API consumes too much time from your human resources, turn them into open-source projects and host them on GitHub. This way, your customers can contribute to the development and bug fixing of the SDKs, accelerating the growth process.

3. **Simplify API troubleshooting:**
   Debugging itself is tiresome, let alone for a program using an API. The solution to this is an API Dashboard. This dashboard is where a developer goes to see the logs of requests and callbacks, making debugging easier for them.

4. **Simplify developer support processes:**
   Ideally, there should be a support team that responds to customer questions. However, since these API developers are usually the ones who need to respond to user questions, tracking issues submitted on GitHub and responding to questions on Stack Overflow can help improve the developer experience.

I hope the above points, which I tried to summarize, are helpful to you. Your feedback can contribute to improving and enhancing the content quality ;)
