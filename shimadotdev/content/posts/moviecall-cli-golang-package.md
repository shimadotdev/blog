Movicall started as a learning project to get hands-on experience with Go. I wanted to understand its unique features, especially concurrency and goroutines. By building Movicall, I aimed to create something practical while sharpening my programming skills.

## What is Moviecall?

Movicall is a CLI app designed for searching movies and TV shows by their name. The results are displayed in a table format, providing complete names, ratings, languages, genres, and links to detailed webpages on the TMDB (The Movie Database) site. I used the [TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started) to power this functionality.

## Features

- Search Movies and TV Shows: Find movies and TV shows by name.
- Detailed Results: The app presents a table of results with names, ratings, languages, genres, year, and a link to the TMDB page for each entry.
